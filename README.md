# Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy

## Overview of the Project<br>


### Project : Dynamic Pricing Strategy <br>

### Objective : <br>
Dynamic Pricing is an application of Data Science that involves adjusting product or service prices based on various factors in real time. It is employed by businesses to optimize their revenue and profitability by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, customer behaviour, and competitor pricing. Using data-driven insights and algorithms, businesses can dynamically modify prices to achieve the most favourable outcomes.

### Key activities<br>
**Data Collection and Understanding:** Collected the ride sharing company dataset from a reliable source. Understood the dataset's structure, including the number of rows, columns, and data types.<br>
**Visualizations:** Created visualizations to communicate findings effectively.<br>
**Correlation Analysis:** Computed the correlation coefficients to identify relationships between numerical features. Visualized correlations using a heatmap to identify strong positive or negative correlations.<br>

### Technologies Used<br>
**Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.<br>
**Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.<br>
**Pandas:** A library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.<br>
**NumPy:** A library for numerical computations, which provides support for arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>
**Matplotlib:** A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.<br>
**Seaborn:** A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.<br>
**SciKit Learn:** Random Forest regression model is used for making prediction to predict prices considering various factors .
